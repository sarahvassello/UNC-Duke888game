       <p class="lead">Three years ago, there had recently been a storm. It was February 20, 2014. </p>
       <p>
         Eight days ago, the anticipated UNC-Duke game was snowed out, fans walking away from the
         Dean Dome with sadness in their eyes and disappointments in their hearts. Classes were
         canceled for the next day. What should have been a bustling campus on rivalry game day
          turned into a deserted tundra.
       </p>
       <p>
         Eight miles away, the Duke men’s basketball team went home, getting more time to practice
        before traveling to UNC.
       </p>
       <p>
         As unpredictable as the North Carolina weather was the UNC men’s basketball team. They were on a seven-game streak, but it’s called a streak for a reason — they don’t last.
       </p>
       <p>
         But the game was at the Dean Dome. And they had the fuel of a rivalry on their side.

        <div class="col-md-6">
        <p> He was a first-year, and somehow he got Duke tickets. When senior Kyle Edmonds heard the game might be canceled, he was working on a lab report. He wasn’t one of the thousands standing in line for tickets, but he was still disappointed when he heard the game was rescheduled.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was really excited to have the potential to be in the bottom bowl of the Dean Dome,” he said. “I think it would create an environment that would be likewise to Cameron Indoor, something that would be much more difficult to play in.”

    </p>
    <p>
      But he was in the upper deck at the Feb. 20 game, a matchup when location didn’t really matter and enthusiasm was everything.

    </p>
    <p>
      For the eight days between the two game days, Edmonds said the tension was almost palpable.

    </p>
    <p>
      “It was kind of like Beat Duke week, part two,” he said. “There was so much more animosity and everyone was so much more riled up about the game.”

    </p>
    <p>
      When he entered the Dean Dome on Feb. 20 on phase four tickets, he knew the game was going to be intense.
    </p>
    <p>
      He described it as absolutely wild.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was enamored by how many people were there and how loud it was,” he said. “Just being with so many other students and other Carolina fans was absolutely insane. It was out of this world. It was so loud.”
    </p>
    <p>When UNC made free throws, the stadium was silent, he said.
      <p>
        “It was so loud when Duke was playing rather than when UNC was playing, you could hear a pin drop,” he said.
    <p>The game picked up in the final moments, and it was clear within the last few seconds that UNC was going to take the win.
<p>
  Edmonds was in the upper deck, and he started running toward the court. He was at the risers by the playing of the alma mater. After celebrating on the court, everyone filed out and ran to Franklin Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think it’ll always be iconic because the students who did get to come, that victory was so much sweeter because of that extra game because they wigged out the first time, and we still beat them anyway the second time,” he said.
</p>
  <p>
    “It was definitely one of my favorite experiences I’ve ever had in Carolina basketball."

          <p>He wasn’t even in college yet. He was a junior at Chapel Hill High School.</p>
          <p>And he walked six miles to get to the Feb. 12 game.</p>
          <p>He got a ticket when snow was predicted, and out-of-towners were selling their tickets for a relatively low price of $80.</p>
          <p>“We had to be there,” he said. So he and his friends walked to the Dean Dome. In the snow. Maybe uphill. From his house on the outskirts of town. “We never really thought twice about it.”</p>
          <p>As soon as they got on campus, the game was cancelled. </p>
          <p>But he still had tickets to the rescheduled game, and he was going.</p>
          <p>Once inside of the Dean Dome, he said the atmosphere was ridiculous.</p>
          <p>“People had this pent up feeling of excitement for eight days, so people were excited and ready to go,” he said. </p>
          <p>It was his first Carolina-Duke game. And it was the first time he rushed Franklin Street. </p>
          <p>“Growing up, you establish a huge, huge love for the University. Both of my parents work here, both of my brothers went here, I’m trying to transfer here for next year. I’m just a massive Carolina fan,” he said.</p>
          <p>“The Carolina-Duke rivalry is just something to look forward to. It’s always going to be a great game.” </p>

          <p>She had just gotten out of her Latin American Politics class, and Rachel Gogal went straight to the Dean Dome. It was around 2 p.m.</p>
          <p>The game didn’t start until 8 p.m. And she was willing to stand in line until she got tickets. She estimates she was around the fifth person in line. </p>
          <p>And she was turned away when the game was canceled.</p>
          <p>“It was more excitement that was being built up. It wasn’t even a letdown because I wasn’t upset with the team or the University — it was just further amplifying my hatred for Duke,” she said.</p>
          <p>But the decision did set off a unification for school spirit, she said. </p>
          <p> “It was unexpected, really aggravating call that Duke had canceled,” she said. “Next thing you know, you see Chapel Hill Transit busses and people taking the eight mile trips to taunt the team.”</p>
          <p>She wasn’t able to get into the Feb. 20 game either — but that didn’t stop her from watching in her Morrison dorm, surrounded by her friends. </p>
          <p>“You’re sitting in one dorm room, but you hear cheering from three floors above when Marcus Paige makes a shot,” she said.</p>
          <p>She was wearing boots when she rushed Franklin Street from her south campus dorm, a choice she said she will not be making again. </p>
          <p>Once she was on Franklin Street, she said the adrenaline was incredible. </p>
          <p>“You’re amongst thousands of people coming from all over,” she said. “When you get there, it’s a huge celebration. I didn’t get that experience again until my senior year.”</p>
          <p>Gogal said she didn’t remember the specifics of the next day too well, but she knew for a fact what it felt like.</p>
          <p>“I kind of just changes the mood in the classroom. Everyone’s happy, but it’s one of those things that you’re still on the high 24 hours after, she said. </p>

      <p>One of the most historic and intense rivalries in not only college basketball, but the world of sports,
        the Battle of the Blues are known nationally. According to a poll conducted by ESPN in 2000,
        the UNC-Duke rivalry is the third greatest in American sports.
      </p>
      <p>
        The private/public school dimension adds class dynamics to the rivalry, but — as evident by
          "8 mile" upset during incliment weather, distance is a huge factor (note: Duke University is
          actually about 11 miles away).
      </p>
