       <p class="lead">It was February 20, 2014. There was recently a storm.</p>
       <p>
         Eight days ago, the anticipated UNC-Duke game was snowed out, fans walking away from the
         Dean Dome with sadness in their eyes and disappointments in their hearts. Classes were
         canceled for the next day. What should have been a bustling campus on rivalry game day
          turned into a deserted tundra.
       </p>
       <p>
         Eight miles away, the Duke men’s basketball team went home, getting more time to practice
        before traveling to UNC.
       </p>
       <p>
         As unpredictable as the North Carolina weather was the UNC men’s basketball team. T
         hey were on a seven-game streak, but it’s called a streak for a reason — they don’t last.
       </p>
       <p>
         But the game was at the Dean Dome. And they had the fuel of a rivalry on their side.

        <div class="col-md-6">
        <p> Jane Wester was only a first-year at UNC on Feb. 20, 2014, but she’s been a UNC
          basketball fan since birth. In her words, her dad indoctrinated her at a young age,
           and she hasn’t been able to get over it since.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remembers the original date of the Duke game — Feb. 12 — well. She was a first-year
       and there was no chance she was getting tickets. She planned to watch it in her dorm room
       with friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, there was not snow. And then classes were canceled.
    </p>
    <p>
      “People were jumping on the tables and screaming and it was awesome,” she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother, who went to UNC School of Law in the 1990s, texted her as soon as he heard, and
       said she needed to get down to the Dean Dome as soon as possible. There was a similar situation
        when he went to UNC. There was a chance she could get in.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was on her way over to stand in line for reserved tickets when she heard the game was canceled.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was crushed, but found solace in the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Those hours of hope and snow play — those were good hours,” she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight days later, she rushed Franklin Street from Ehringhaus, taking breaks to walk because her friend had a concussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s only in Duke games where your body is taken over by an external force,” she said.
</p>
  <p>
    “The anticipation was definitely the most ever, that afternoon. It’s the one we won.”
